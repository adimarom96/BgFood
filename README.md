##  Overview

This is a full-stack recipe website built with Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Vue. The site uses external APIs to fetch recipe data and MySQL to store user data such as registration, login, favorite recipes, last seen recipes, and user-created recipes.



##  Server-Side Development

The server-side of the application is built with Node.js and Express.js. It handles the business logic of the application and provides an API for the client-side to consume. The server communicates with a MySQL database  to store user data such as registration, login, favorite recipes, last seen recipes, and user-created recipes.
The server also uses external APIs to get additional data when needed.

##  Client-Side Development

The client-side is built with Vue and uses a single-page application (SPA) architecture, which allows for a more seamless and responsive user experience.
The client-side is communicates with the server-side API to retrieve and display data.
